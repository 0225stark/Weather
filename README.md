# Weather
Current Weather report  of a City, built using NodeJs  


Here I had taken city = Delhi.

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=28.6667&lon=77.2167&appid=fda8d6b6dfc94d19780b6b9b828e5f61

To run the project on your server, create a apikey of https://api.openweathermap.org.
Pick any city you want.
Change the lat and lon value of the picked city.

Run the project through the command - nodemon index.js

Output result on the localhost:8000 => https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98046589/233343160-48b0a44f-27ed-454c-a1b1-71949b71646c.png
